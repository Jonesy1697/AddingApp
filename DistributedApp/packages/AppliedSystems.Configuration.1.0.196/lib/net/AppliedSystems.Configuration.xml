            Reads a section of configuration from app.config into type of the same name as that section 
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            In app.config the section must have a section entry in configSections with the name set appropriately
            and the type set to "AppliedSystems.Configuration.XmlSerializerSectionHandler, AppliedSystems.Configuration".
            
            Only elements can be used to populate their namesake in the specified configuration section type, 
            attributes will not be populated.
            
            The config element names are case sensitive and must match the naming in the specified configuration section type.
            This therefore deviates from the standard camel-cased config naming.
